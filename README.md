# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Employee Management System (React + Vite)
Developed a fully functional Employee Management System using React and Vite for fast build times and optimized development experience. The application allows administrators and employees to manage and view employee information efficiently. It features user authentication, dynamic dashboards, and CRUD functionalities. The use of React hooks and context API ensures smooth state management across components, while Vite provides lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) for a seamless development workflow.

You can tweak or modify it further depending on the specific features and your involvement.
